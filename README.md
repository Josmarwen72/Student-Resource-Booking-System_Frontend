- **Resource Booking**: Students can view available resources and book them for specific time slots.
- **View Current Bookings**: Students can see and manage their existing bookings.

## Report on Issues Encountered during Development

### **Issue 1: CORS Policy Error**

**Description:**
While attempting to perform registration and login from the frontend, the following CORS error was encountered:
```
Access to fetch at 'http://192.168.100.7:4000/api/auth/register' from origin 'http://192.168.100.7:5500' has been blocked by CORS policy...
```

**Cause:**
This issue was caused by incorrect CORS configuration. The backend was not allowing the specific origin (`http://192.168.100.7:5500`) to access the resources.



### **Issue 2: Failed Registration/Failed Fetch**

**Description:**
During the registration process, the following error message was displayed:
```
Registration error: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

**Cause:**
This error was likely caused by either an incorrect API endpoint or CORS-related issues, resulting in the registration request not being properly processed by the backend.

### **Issue 3: Slot Booking Issue**

**Description:**
The frontend was unable to add a slot when trying to make a booking.

**Cause:**
This issue was likely due to the absence of proper API calls or incorrect handling of the form submission in the frontend JavaScript logic.
